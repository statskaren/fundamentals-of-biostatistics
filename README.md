# Fundamentals of Biostatistics (Rosner) — R implementations and issues

This repository contains R code, exercises, and analyses based on the book  
**"Fundamentals of Biostatistics" (by Bernard Rosner)**.  
The goal is to reproduce and explore the main statistical concepts using **R Markdown**.

## Structure and main files

Each chapter of the book has its own folder with R Markdown files and outputs:

```bash
📁 fundamentals-of-biostatistics/
├── 📄 template.odt # A LibreOffice template for reports (can be customized and saved as .docx)
├── 📁 chapter01/
│   ├── 📄 chapter01.Rmd # Main R Markdown file for Chapter 1
│   ├── 📄 chapter01.odt # Rendered report for Chapter 1
│   ├── 📁 data/ # Datasets used in Chapter 1
│   └── 📁 plots/ # Graphs generated by the code in Chapter 1
├── 📁 chapter02/
│   ├── 📄 chapter02.Rmd
│   └── ...
└── 📄 render_all.R # Script to render all chapters at once
```bash 
---
  
Now, we're gonna see how to reproduce, step by step

# 1. Open Rstudio and install the required packages:
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))

# 2. Render a Chapter previously downloaded:  
#You'll need to open the R Markdown file for the chapter you want to render, e.g., chapter01.Rmd
#So, you can run the following command in the R console:

rmarkdown::render("chapter01/chapter01.Rmd")

#Note that this will generate an output file (chapter01.odt) in the same folder.

# 3. Render all chapters at once:
source("render_all.R")

# 4. Customize the template:
#You can modify the template.odt file to change the appearance of the rendered reports.
#I made this template using LibreOffice, but you can also use Microsoft Word by saving it as .docx.
#Also, this template is optional and I used the main main Brazilian academic styles (Vancouver and sometimes ABNT).

# 5. Explore and modify the code:
#Feel free to explore the R code in each chapter's Rmd file.
#You can modify it to fit your own data or to practice different analyses.

# 6. Share and collaborate:
#If you find any errors or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
#Feel free to send me an e-mail!
